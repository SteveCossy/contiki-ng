The ORouter is a routing device that forwards data packets 
between networks.ORouter is capable of IPV4/IPV6 routing device.
The device integrates the ENC28J60 ethernet module,
supporting up to 30VDC.The micro-USB is used for both 
powering the device over USB (5VDC), and programming/debugging.
Oppila border router for 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4, 6LoWPAN, and 
ZigBee applications orouter is havnig following features

 * ARM Cortex-M3 with 512KB flash and 32KB RAM (16KB retention), 32MHz.
 * ISM 2.4-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 & Zigbee compliant.
 * on-board PCB for 2.4GHz antenna
 * RJ45 ethernet connector
 * Ethernet 10BASE-T IPv4/IP64
 * On-board CP2104 to flash over its micro-USB connector
 * LED, buttons 
 * AES-128/256, SHA2 Hardware Encryption Engine.
 * ECC-128/256, RSA Hardware Acceleration Engine for Secure Key Exchange.

Other features
==============

	This radio is compatible with existing and trending protocols such as Thread, but you can also develop your own applications on top of very well 
	supported protocols like 6LoWPAN and IEEE 802.15.4, without vendor restrictions or licenses.
	
	The maximum range is between 100 meters and 20 km, with highly configurable radio parameters such as modulation, data rate, transmission power, etc.

	Increased security with on-board hardware security (SHA2, AES-128/256, ECC-128/256 and RSA for secure key exchange)

	Out of the box connectivity with IPv6 and IPv4 networks and services, using IP64 (NAT64, DHCP64)
