Oppila Microsystems omote platform -  http://www.oppila.in
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The omote platform is a IoT Hardware development platform based
on TI's CC2538 system on chip (SoC), featuring an ARM Cortex-M3 with 512KB
flash, 32Kb RAM, 2.4GHz RF interface , and the
following goodies:

* ISM 2.4-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 & Zigbee compliant.
* AES-128/256, SHA2 Hardware Encryption Engine.
* ECC-128/256, RSA Hardware Acceleration Engine for Secure Key Exchange.
* On board sensors LDR, ADXL345 and BMP180
* Power input with wide range 3.7-30VDC.
* Programming over BSL by enetring into bootloader mode
* On-board micro USB connector for USB 2.0 applications.
* Two LEDs
* User, BSL and Reset buttons.
* On-board printed PCB 2.4Ghz antenna. 

Port Features

The omote has the following key features:

  * Deep Sleep support with RAM retention for ultra-low energy consumption.
  * Native USB support (CDC-ACM). SLIP over UART for border routers is no longer a bottleneck.
  * DMA transfers for increased performance (RAM to/from RF, RAM to/from USB).

The omote has 13 pinouts to connect boolean,digital and analog sensors based on I2C,UART,and SPI Protocols as well as other sensors or actuators you may need to connect.
