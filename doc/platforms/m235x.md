Getting Started:

## Clone Contiki-NG

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng.git
$ cd contiki-ng
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Patch bsp

```bash
./tools/m235xbsp-patch/m235x-post-checkout.sh
```

files modified:
* arch/cpu/m2351/bsp/Library/Device/Nuvoton/M2351/Source/system_M2351.c
* arch/cpu/m2354/bsp/Library/Device/Nuvoton/M2354/Source/system_M2354.c

files renamed:
* arch/cpu/m2351/bsp/Library/StdDriver/src/timer.c -> nu_timer.c
* arch/cpu/m2351/bsp/Library/StdDriver/src/spi.c -> nu_spi.c
* arch/cpu/m2354/bsp/Library/StdDriver/src/timer.c -> nu_timer.c
* arch/cpu/m2354/bsp/Library/StdDriver/src/spi.c -> nu_spi.c

*Note*: because Contiki-ng already has files named as "timer.c", "spi.c", the files with same name have to be renamed.
